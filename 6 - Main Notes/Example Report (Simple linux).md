# 0. Summary

### FTP
- Access and Environment
- Anonymous FTP access was enabled on port 21
- We identified this as a home directory for user john
- Several important configuration and history files were accessible

### Critical Files
- .bash_history file revealed potential credentials: john:SuperSecurePass123
- SSH private key (id_rsa) was obtained and is not password protected
- WordPress setup documentation revealed temporary FTP configuration

### Security Implications
- Exposed SSH private key could allow unauthorized system access
- FTP server was intended to be temporary but remained accessible
- Internal documentation exposed system configuration details
- Command history revealed sensitive operations and potential credentials

### WordPress
- Running WordPress version 6.7.2 (Latest version)
- Server: Apache/2.4.52 (Ubuntu)
- XML-RPC enabled and accessible
- Theme: twentytwentyfive v1.0
- Plugin: hash-form v1.1.0 - vulnerable to RCE (CVE-2024-5084)

**Subject: Update on WordPress Blog Setup**

Dear Team,

We are currently in the process of setting up a new blog using WordPress.
To facilitate this setup, we have temporarily configured an FTP server.

Please note:
- This FTP server is for internal use only during the initial setup phase.
- Access credentials are temporary and will be revoked once the blog setup is complete or if security necessitates it.

However, we have recently received a high-priority ticket that requires immediate attention. As a result,
the completion of the blog setup will be slightly delayed. We are committed to addressing this urgent issue first to ensure our services remain uninterrupted.

We will notify the responsible parties as soon as the WordPress blog and web application are fully operational.
We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work to prioritize our tasks effectively.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best Regards,
John Doe
Development Team
